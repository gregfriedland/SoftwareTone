SoftwareTone: an Arduino library to generate square wave tones on pins 2-13.
Written by Greg Friedland, November 20, 2011.

With hardware PWM, you could make square waves on up to 6 pins by using up all the hardware timers. This
can be limiting in some cases, such as wehn you want to use the timers for other things including some
of the built-in Arduino functionality. The motivation for this library is to allow creation of square wave 
tones on more pins than is possible with hardware PWM alone, up to 12 pin excluding 0 and 1, which are import
for serial communication.

To use this library, first download the code from include <SoftwareTone.h

This library depends on the TimerOne library, and you must include <TimerOne.h> in your sketch. (This should
be unnecessary because this file is included in the library also but it's an idiosyncrasy of the Arduino
environment AFAIK.) If you don't include this header
