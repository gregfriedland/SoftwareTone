SoftwareTone: an Arduino library to generate square wave tones on pins 2-13.
Written by Greg Friedland, November 20, 2011.

With hardware PWM, you could make square waves on up to 6 pins by using up all the hardware timers. This
can be limiting in some cases, such as when you want to use the timers for other things including some
of the built-in Arduino functionality. The motivation for this library is to allow creation of square wave 
tones on more pins than is to avoid these limitations and to generate sqaure waves on more pins than is possible
with hardware PWM alone, up to 12 pin excluding 0 and 1 (which are important for serial communication).

To install this library, first download the code from https://github.com/gregfriedland/SoftwareTone/zipball/master.
Unzip the downloaded zip file and copy the SoftwareTone directory to <ArduinoDirectory>/libraries. On Mac OS X, 
this would be at ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries.

Usage is:

init(): 
	initialize the library before using it.

setFreq(pin, frequency):
	set the frequency of the given pin. 

enablePin(pin):
	enable the given pin (2-13) for software tone generation.

disablePin(pin):
	disable the given pin (2-13) for software tone generation.	



This library depends on the TimerOne library and you must include <TimerOne.h> in your sketch. (This should
be unnecessary because this file is included in the library also but it's an idiosyncrasy of the Arduino
environment AFAIK.) If you don't include this header, you will get a compile timer error such as:
	    SoftwareTone/SoftwareTone.cpp:8:22: error: TimerOne.h: No such file or directory
	    SoftwareTone/SoftwareTone.cpp: In member function 'void SoftwareToneClass::init()':
	    SoftwareTone/SoftwareTone.cpp:21: error: 'Timer1' was not declared in this scope

An example sketch is available in the examples directory.

Happy tone generation!
